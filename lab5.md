#### Instructions

1. Examine the results from the Get Network Routes module in the Module Output pane. What do you notice? Is this system connected to multiple networks? If the additional networks do not appear it doesn't always mean they don't exist. You can move onto the next step.  
2. Set the attack source to the HR-DMILLS agent by right-clicking on the agent and selecting Set as Source.
3. Run the Network Information Gathering RPT on the 10.12.16.0/24 network. Refer to Lab Exercise 2 if necessary. Wait for the RPT to complete before moving on.
4. Notice the newly discovered system. Attack this system by dragging the Network Attack and Penetration RPT onto the newly discovered system. Remember to check for Network Exposures.

This concludes the lab exercise, continue to exercise 6.
